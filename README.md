# CalFit

This is the node backend of a chrome extension. It authorises the user, creates a new event (for the purpose of demonstration) and gets all the calendar events. We sync the chrome extension with a bug tracking software where
once the user has finished fixing one bug, it checks if he has an upcoming meeting and pushes a notification to take a break using Google Cloud Messaging Service to all the devices the user uses. These devices includes Android phone,
Google chrome or iPhone.

#Usage

The chrome extension will be available on the Google store within the next week for you to test!
